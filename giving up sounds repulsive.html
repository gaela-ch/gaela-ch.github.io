To have written 5,795 words this month without reference to the conflict
in Gaza feels absurd. This US-sanctioned slaughter is hard not to
constantly have on your mind, especially when doing anything else
borders on feeling immoral. To not write about Gaza would fail to
capture what is beautiful yet possible whether it stems from worldwide
solidarity, young people willing to do the bare minimum, or a class flag
proudly flying over Limerick. This absence would also fail to capture
the springs of solidarity and hate spurred on by the Israeli Occupation,
giving us new ways to confirm or deny our respective humanity. Escapism
clears the room of anything better, even if that&rsquo;s just analysis. This
Genocide will and should remain unavoidable, necessitating messier
paragraphs.
</p>

<p>
To write about Palestine is to reveal your place in the world, with
nobody being truly neutral. Clear lines have once again developed
between <i>&rsquo;the West&rsquo;</i> and &rsquo;the Rest&rsquo;, a development reflected by media
coverage and public discourse. In our case, the Free State government
found itself wedged between <i>&rsquo;West&rsquo;</i> and <i>&rsquo;Wretched&rsquo;,</i> lagging behind
their metropolitan cousins in their attempts to downplay Palestinian
solidarity. While ARD and ZDF in Germany are free to
<a href="https://www.jungewelt.de/artikel/462874.berichterstattung-zum-gazakrieg-journalistische-bankrotterkl%C3%A4rung.html?sstr=ARD%7CHamas">adjust
their coverage</a> or insert bad takes into their equivalent to <i>&rsquo;Match of
the Day&rsquo;</i>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/RTE_PrimeTime/status/1712581729414738238">RTÉ are
still letting the Zionists look bad on occasion</a>. Decades of solidarity
and struggle have forced Martin and company to be subtle, sending out
vague calls for peace between attempts at placating the US and Israel.
We&rsquo;ve also seen sections of the far-right identifying with the Zionist
state outright, with those claiming otherwise often being insecure about
not being a settler. To not write about Palestine is to pretend that the
Irish people are pathetic, doomed to implement themselves into the exact
systems they once fought against.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/QuinlivanTD/status/1725892973454377433/photo/1">https://twitter.com/QuinlivanTD/status/1725892973454377433/photo/1</a>
</p>

<p>
However, writing about this Genocide is impossible without writing about
everything else. We must disrupt and expose each silence that brought us
here, openly stating the racist and colonial nature of the Israeli
state. To place children in a cage is a statement, and to live in sweet
ignorance of said statement is pathetic. Like all forms of colonialism,
Zionism necessitates a perception of the Palestinian people as
perpetually <i>&ldquo;lesser&rdquo;</i>, devaluing their literature and culture in order
to justify rape and pillage. Palestine is never allowed to speak for
herself, with each attempt being met with brutal violence. <i>&ldquo;The most
moral army in the world&rdquo;</i> doesn&rsquo;t offer vegan boots out of a love of
animals, it just looks for any opportunity to depict Palestinians as
being even lesser.
</p>

<p>
The Irish people have stood strong in this struggle against
dehumanisation, with our literature and language serving as an extended
middle finger towards notions of a singular, &ldquo;civilised&rdquo; West. On
account of our radical tradition, refusing to engage with Palestine&rsquo;s
intellectual and political struggle for freedom is the ultimate form of
abdication - making it very clear who actually places value in the words
that they read, listen to, or learn. To write about Palestine is to
care, and to care is to be free. This newsletter is actually about
<i>&rsquo;Gaza Writes Back&rsquo;,</i> a collection of short stories edited by the late
Refaat Alareer.

There&rsquo;s something utterly crushing in discovering an artist&rsquo;s true depth
as their light starts to fade. These last few months have been awful in
this regard, with the words of Shane MacGowan and Benjamin Zephaniah
haunting a winter defined by death. Yet the sudden snuffing of Refaat
Alareer&rsquo;s light and life cut deep, capturing the attention of the world.
<a href="https://twitter.com/TomaiRua/status/1733871322474635280">Tomaí Ó
Conghaile&rsquo;s thoughtful translation of <i>&rsquo;Más éigean dom an bás&rsquo;</i> forced
this train of thought to cohere</a>, making utterly clear which lights had
been extinguished so cowardly. Refaat was now just a tale, one we must
all finish.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/TomaiRua/status/1733871322474635280">https://twitter.com/TomaiRua/status/1733871322474635280</a>
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s not enough to depict Refaat as <i>just</i> a journalist, translator,
scholar, or poet. It&rsquo;s certainly not enough to solely depict him through
English either. Alareer&rsquo;s work expands on and blurs the lines between
fiction and polemic - with his decision to write in English being
pointed, yet deeply considered. Refaat is more than happy to use <i>an
teanga iasachta</i> inconveniently, mirroring Pearse and Hyde in his choice
to polemicise <i>at</i> instead of <i>with</i> the English-reading public. This is
most blatantly seen in the introduction to <i>&rsquo;Gaza Strikes Back&rsquo;,</i> with
the project being rooted in the wider view that <i>&ldquo;the notion of giving
up, or surrendering to the occupation, [&#x2026;] sounds quite repulsive&rdquo;.</i>
Refaat refused to accept any supposed inferiority, with Israel viewing
the innate humanity of his work as an existential threat.
</p>

<p>
Within <i>&rsquo;How Does She Stand&rsquo;,</i> Pearse finds himself pondering the legacy
left by Wolfe Tone. Central to Pearse&rsquo;s perception of Tone is <i>&ldquo;an
immense tenderness and charity&rdquo;,</i> with Tone&rsquo;s final sacrifice reflecting
a deep love for his people:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Yes, this man could love well; and it was from such love as this that
he exiled himself; which such love as this crushed in his faithful heart
that he became a weary but indomitable ambassador to courts and camps,
with the memory of such love as this, with the little hands of his
children plucking at his heartstrings, that he lay down to die in that
cell on Arbour Hill.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>&rsquo;Gaza Writes Back</i>&rsquo; **is a literal labour of love, with each story
fuelled by forms of passion and sacrifice that are totally foreign to
those controlling the drones. Alareer and Tone were willing to face
<i>&ldquo;the high and sorrowful destiny of the heroes&rdquo;</i> not out of some
barbaric irrationality, but instead, a level of love solely found
amongst us &rsquo;barbarians&rsquo;.

<p>
When reading about each writer that contributed towards <i>&rsquo;Gaza Writes
Back&rsquo;,</i> the daily horrors inherent to Israel&rsquo;s occupation become clear.
Authors are largely young and female, <i>&ldquo;most if not all [&#x2026;] have never
been to other places in Palestine&rdquo;,</i> and all face conditions that get in
the way of their writing. As outlined in the collection&rsquo;s introduction:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The lengthy political, economic, and intellectual siege that Israel has
maintained around Gaza meant that, as they worked on their stories, all
of our writers &#x2014; like every single person living in Gaza &#x2014; had to
cope with the constant and debilitating structural violence of power
cuts, isolation, unemployment, lack of basic goods, lack of books, lack
of medicine and access to health care, extreme difficulty in traveling
outside Gaza, and far too often pain, death, or the loss of loved ones.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While it&rsquo;s genuinely impressive that any form of writing was possible in
such conditions, what makes <i>&rsquo;Gaza Writes Back&rsquo;</i> worth reading is its
depth, with deep levels of empathy and authenticity shaping each story.
Our protagonists are almost constantly aware of those suffering,
comparing their traumas with those worse off. This can be seen most
blatantly in Rawan Yaghi&rsquo;s <i>&rsquo;From Beneath&rsquo;</i>, a story based around the
bleak experience of bleeding to death following an Israeli airstrike.
Despite everything, our protagonist finds himself wanting to help, even
though he can&rsquo;t move a limb. This fundamental empathy fuels some of the
best contributions towards this collection - with <i>&rsquo;Neverland</i>&rsquo; covering
the experiences of a health worker who can&rsquo;t help but think about the
children she treats, <i>‘House&rsquo;</i> discussing the morality of revenge, and
<i>&rsquo;Scars&rsquo;</i> depicting **the struggles of parenthood during under
occupation. <i>&rsquo;Gaza Writes Back&rsquo;</i> is an utterly <i>real</i> book, with its
depth contrasting heavily with the two-dimensional depiction of the
Palestinian people the West occupies themselves with.
</p>

<p>
One of the most intriguing examples of this book&rsquo;s empathy is Nour
Al-Sousi&rsquo;s <i>&rsquo;Canary&rsquo;</i>, a piece that alternates perspectives between a
resistance fighter and an IDF soldier. This choice of plot is
particularly brave for the author considering how tripe previous
attempts at tackling it have been, with authors on the outside falling
into the same tropes over and over. However, this story actually works
due to Al-Sousi&rsquo;s experiences, with there being something uniquely
fascinating in seeing how someone depicts the life and thought process
of someone totally opposed to her existence - especially when you
consider the fact that most people growing up in Gaza have likely never
met an Israeli without uniform. Al-Sousi does what professional writers
in Israel seem unwilling to do, raising depressing questions.

One of the most absurd aspects of colonialism is the extent to which
those on the receiving end are stuck with the burden of conciliation,
having to display a superhuman level of restraint to prove their
humanity. In the same way that cultural colonisation forces our thoughts
to be based around their occupiers, any discussion for a transition
towards something new will always prioritise the interests of a
colonising minority over everyone else. You can see this quite blatantly
in discussions about reunification, with every aspect of our discourse
solely being based around the whims of Unionists - even more so when
they refuse to participate. A one-sided relationship develops, with
those stuck on colonialism&rsquo;s receiving end being expected to bridge
every divide they&rsquo;ve had forced onto them.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s hard not to start reading <i>&rsquo;Canary</i>&rsquo; through this lens, with
Al-Sousi&rsquo;s depiction of someone <i>&ldquo;on the other side&rdquo;</i> contrasting
heavily with the pure bile being posted by ardent Zionists. We&rsquo;ve seen
Israeli soldiers

teachers for seeing Palestinians as human</a>. Those rambling on about
<i>&ldquo;both sides&rdquo;</i> or the abstract need for <i>&ldquo;class unity&rdquo;</i> conveniantly
fudge and ignore the extent of this hate, often on account of being
culturally closer to those doing the settling. <i>&ldquo;Both sides&rdquo;</i> have never
been equal, with one expected to do all the work necessary to solve a
problem they didn&rsquo;t start.
</p>

<p>
This isn&rsquo;t to say that unity is impossible, but instead that it first
requires some level of mutual understanding. However, this concept is
anathema to the colonial logic behind Zionism, with attempts to
<i>&ldquo;civilise the civilised&rdquo;</i> generally going nowhere. Colonialism
necessitates a division between the West and the Wretched, eventually
leading to the dehumanisation and destruction of those unlucky enough to
fall outside of the first category. Those supporting Israel&rsquo;s attacks on
Gaza are unable to engage with the works of those like Refaat Alareer as
they actively refuse to see them as human, and no short story or lecture
could ever change that fact.
</p>

<p>
However, it&rsquo;d be wrong to isolate this bleak outlook to Israel. This
devaluation of Palestinian lives is inherent to the ways in which the
West reports on and conceives this conflict - with the deaths of
thousands of Palestinians generally being seen as equally (if not less)
important than one or two undergraduates in America feeling
uncomfortable. While a country like Germany may wax lyrical about their
<i>&ldquo;Staatsräson&rdquo;,</i> it&rsquo;s no coincidence that their ardent support for
Israel comes hand in hand with dogwhistles about migrants. Reading about
Israel is disgusting as they represent the core of the West, a core
that&rsquo;s more than accustomed to killing stories, languages, and the
writers themselves. Rather than being some evil abberation, those
looking to raze down the Gaza strip for Disneyland are the closest thing
that the West has to true believers.

While this may be a depressing note to end the year on, falling into
sheer doomerism is even worse than just doing nothing. Despite years of
struggle and insurmountable odds, the Palestinian people are still brave
enough to survive and write out of spite. Some of the most beautiful
passages in <i>&rsquo;Gaza Writes Back&rsquo;</i> relate to this unceasing dedication to
what Ó Cadhain terms as an <i>&ldquo;illogcial striving for the impossible&rdquo;,</i>
with anything beyond standing up being long out of the question:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Between my father and his Land is an unbreakable bond. Between
Palestinians and their land is an unbreakable bond. By uprooting plants
and cutting trees continually, Israel tries to break that bond and
impose its own rules of despair on Palestinians. By replanting their
trees over and over again, Palestinians are rejecting Israel&rsquo;s rules.
&ldquo;My land, my rules,&rdquo; says Dad.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We must learn from the dedication running through each page of this
collection, being willing to create and take sacrifices <i>ar son na
cúise.</i> We must reaffirm our deep solidarity with the people of
Palestine, making it clear that the Irish nation stand in opposition to
colonial plunder. We must continue learning to read, write, and think
for ourselves - stepping out beyond the Anglosphere and engaging with
more than just our deranged neighbours. We must live to tell Refaat&rsquo;s
tale, ideally after Reconquest. <i>Athbhliain faoi mhaise daoibh go léir.</i>

<b>fuaimrian na seachtaine:</b> jane remover - kodak moment

<p>
Beidh orm rud éigin a scríobh faoi Jane Remover san athbhliain, go
háirithe agus í ag dul ó neart go neart le gairid. Tháinig mé ar Jane
mar gheall ar <i>&rsquo;Dariacore&rsquo;,</i> an tionscadal leath-magúil agus ró-&rsquo;ar
líne&rsquo; a bhí aici i rith na paindéime. Is léir domsa go bhfuil Jane duine
de na ceoltóirí &rsquo;Iar-Covid&rsquo; is tabhachtaí, rud a leiríonn an rian
tochtmhar seo go paiteanta.
