<p>
A spectre is haunting Ireland - the spectre of our neighbours. If one
looks at a majority of our cultural and political discourse, it often
seems as if we never discuss anything beyond the one-sided relationship
we share with the U.K and the U.S - alternating between obsessing over
each respective neighbour and decrying their deep ignorance of our
country and culture. This obsessive, unrequited relationship is seen
constantly on Irish social media - we &ldquo;ironically&rdquo; scour the tabloids
for every snippet of Prince Harry&rsquo;s autobiography and then shout at
these papers for being unable to say our names. We end up providing
constant running commentary on the lives of annoying people we nominally
want to be independent of.
</p>

<p>
The tone of this running commentary has always interested me, in part on
account of it&rsquo;s oddly moralistic tone. It sometimes feels as if we
subconsciously view acceptance from our colonisers as a reward we have
earned due to our our collective investment and interest in the world
they have built. Rather than actually wanting to take our own path, we
want our revolution broadcast on the BBC - feeling the need for constant
observation and approval by our respective masters. The second the
actual nature of our colonial relationship seeps through the mouth of
some ignorant politician or journalist, we collectively lose it,
shouting down the online void in an attempt to redeem our earned
respect. However, this constant offence seems surreal from a distance.
We shouldn&rsquo;t feel shocked that those who destroyed our culture and
language place very little value in these things - if anything we should
be shocked about the extent to which we value theirs. This week I&rsquo;ve set
out to explore this one-sided relationship we are all haunted by, if
anything so we can plan a future escape.

To discuss the nature of our relationship to England and America is to
discuss the question of language, something I have

However, as I have limited my previous writings to the political sphere,
I believe there&rsquo;s value in retreading this ground from a more explicitly
cultural lens.
</p>

<p>
Essential to any understanding of the link between languages and
colonialism is <i>Decolonising the Mind</i>, a series of essays from Kenyan
author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&rsquo;o. Within this book, wa Thiong&rsquo;o aptly observes
the dual character of language, arguing that languages serve not only as
a mode of communication but also as &ldquo;a carrier of culture&rdquo;. In his eyes,
languages provide us with ways of seeing - transferring on certain
values and attitudes to their speakers. Following on from this, the
destruction of languages under colonisation serves as &ldquo;the means of
spiritual subjugation&rdquo;, leading to colonised peoples becoming alienated
from themselves. In his words:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The colonial child was made to see the world and where he stands in it
as seen and defined by or reflected in the culture of the language of
imposition. And since those images are mostly passed on through orature
and literature it meant the child would now only see the world as seen
in the literature of his language of adoption. From the point of view of
alienation, that is of seeing oneself from outside oneself as if one was
another self, it does not matter that the imported literature carried
the great humanist tradition of the best in Shakespeare, Goethe, Balzac,
Tolstoy, Gorky, Brecht, Sholokhov, Dickens. The location of this great
mirror of imagination was necessarily Europe and its history and culture
and the rest of the universe was seen from that centre.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, colonisers are able to recenter the perceptions of the
colonised through linguistic destruction - ensuring that their world and
value system haunt the colonised and that attempts to imagine an
alternate system never arise.
</p>

<p>
One aspect of wa Thiong&rsquo;o&rsquo;s work I feel is often ignored is the extent
to which his definition of decolonisation is internationalist in nature.
His ideal struggle is based more around colonised nations finding their
own place in the world as opposed to these nations shutting themselves
off. Rather than arguing for a return to a utopian monolingual past, wa
Thiong&rsquo;o asks why African authors can&rsquo;t take the words of Tolstoy, Marx,
and Einstein and bring them into their respective languages. Instead of
shying away from existing literature, wa Thiong&rsquo;o argues for the
reconquest of <i>&ldquo;the rich humanist and democratic heritage in the
struggles of other peoples&rdquo;.</i> As opposed to seeking acceptance through
effective use of their outer voices, wa Thiong&rsquo;o argues that colonised
peoples must struggle to maintain and restore their inner one.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-accessible-to-everyone-and-everything">
<p>
I think this dichotomy of inner and outer voices is particularly useful
when analysing our one-sided relationship with the U.K and the U.S - a
dichotomy starkly laid out by Olga Tokarczuk, and referenced by Ciarán Dunbar:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
There are countries out there where people speak English. But not like
us - we have our own languages hidden in our carry-on luggage, in our
cosmetics bags, only ever using English when we travel, and then only in
foreign countries, to foreign people. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine, but English
is their real language! Oftentimes their only language. They don&rsquo;t have
anything to fall back on or turn to in moments of doubt&#x2026; They may be
understood by anyone at any moment, whenever they open their
mouths.[&#x2026;] Wherever they are, people have unlimited access to them -
they are accessible to everyone and everything!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This perpetual accessibility manifests itself in multiple forms, with
silly arguments on Twitter being one of the easiest to write about. If
you&rsquo;ve followed the outrage cycles inherent to the app, you&rsquo;ve
definitely seen an American or an English person get endlessly roasted
for their ignorance on certain issues - an ignorance that is often
proudly thrown into a conversation between Irish people discussing Irish
topics. The lack of any real language barrier (and an overabundance of
confidence in our neighbours) prevents us from being able to talk
amongst ourselves, always being observed by (and always watching) those
on the outside. An inability to talk amongst ourselves makes it harder
for us to place ourselves in the world, with everywhere gradually
morphing into a Diet Coke California.
</p>

<p>
Another form this accessibility takes is cultural, with it being cheaper
to import whatever media we consume than to create it. This is another
area where the language question quite blatantly comes to the fore -
similarly sized countries in Europe have more active cultural and
literary scenes than us solely as it is harder for them to directly
consume works from the cultural powerhouses of the U.K and the U.S. The
lack of a language barrier has left Irish creatives with less space to
exist and experiment, with smaller audiences and the logic of capital
discouraging niche works that&rsquo;d fail to reach a broad (if not), global
audience. This economic pressure can be seen quite blatantly when we
look at the literary sphere, as captured by Chris Beausang:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
From a random-ish sample of 42 contemporary Irish writers, I found that
they were represented by 9 agents working for 6 agencies, with one agent
and one company representing just over 40% of all of them. All of these
agencies were based in London and one agency also had premises in New
York. One author was independent. So the sorts of channels of promotion
and critical appraisal as Pascal Casanova would identify them are almost
exclusively English or American and I would posit the loss of regional
designation or historical orientation in contemporary Irish literature
more generally, as something of a response to this state of affairs.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In basic terms, a lack of cultural space means that Irish artists are
discouraged from ever imagining anything beyond what is instantly
successful and what is palatable to our neighbours.
</p>

<p>
This accessibility also ensures cultural marginalisation, with this
marginalisation arguably defining our existing spheres. While we can
have our own regional mirrors of our neighbour&rsquo;s cultural output, these
mirrors will always take second stage to the real thing - even if they
nominally present themselves as being in opposition. These marginal
alternatives are something you have to specifically opt into, an effort
most people seem unwilling to take. To twist Pádraig Pearse&rsquo;s words, on
some level we all prefer <i>&ldquo;the real British thing to a provincial
understudy&rdquo;,</i> especially when the real deal is instantly accessible.
While I feel uncool for saying this, I think this trend is seen most
blatantly when we talk about football. While I enjoy following the
League of Ireland, it shouldn&rsquo;t really surprise us that casual
supporters sat at home gravitate towards the flashy, accessible excess
of the Premier League. Following the League (or listening to local bands
singing in accents in which they&rsquo;d never speak) occasionally feels like
a hipster choice, a niche consumer statement that will never scale
upwards. It&rsquo;s hard to shout over your wealthier cousins, especially if
you&rsquo;re shouting a similar message.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the year and a half that I&rsquo;ve spent mulling over the
language question has brought me to a very direct conclusion - the
widespread loss of the Irish language has left us culturally stunted.
Our constant availability and engineered lack of a widespread inner
voice have left us unable to escape our relationship with England, even
if we are nominally opposed to it. We&rsquo;re prone to either fully immerse
ourselves in this neighbouring culture or solely define ourselves by
limply opposing it - with neither outcome being conductive to anything
fresh. This argument (and this article) is not to demean what we
currently have, but instead to point out how much we can gain from
cultural and linguistic conquest. But what does this reconquest look
like?

In his diary, poet Seán Ó Ríordáin set out to harshly explain the
difference between writing in English and Irish. He mused:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Ag cur síos ar Éirinn a bhíonn Béarla na hÉireann. Éire féin ag labhairt
is ea an Ghaeilge. Ag faire ar Éirinn ón dtaobh amuigh a bhíonn an
Béarla. Éire ag féachaint amach ar an saol is ea an Béarla. [&#x2026;] Ag
labhairt le Sasana agus leis na Stáit Aontaithe a bhíonn Béarla na
hÉireann, á rá leo: féachaigí cad tá aimsithe agam - tá sé dochreidte -
an rud is aite agus is ciotarúnta agus is rómánsaí dá bhfaca éinne
riamh - Ireland. [&#x2026;] Nuair a thagrann an Béarla don arm seo againne
deir sí, /&rsquo;the Irish Army&rsquo;,</i> rud áitiúil. Deir an Ghaeilge &rsquo;an tArm&rsquo; -
rud daonna. Má phléann an Ghaeilge an tSín, beidh an plé Éireannach.
Mura bpléann an Béarla (Béarla na hÉireann) cúrsaí na hÉireann, ní
bheidh inti ach rud Sasanach./
</p>

<p>
(Hiberno-English is describing Ireland. Ireland herself talking is
Irish. English is watching Ireland from the outside. Irish is Ireland
looking outwards at life. Hiberno-English is talking to England and
America, saying to them: look at what I&rsquo;ve found - it&rsquo;s incredible - the
most queer, contrary, and romantic thing anyone&rsquo;s ever seen - Ireland.
[&#x2026;] When English references our army it says &rsquo;the Irish Army&rsquo;,
something local. Irish says &rsquo;the Army&rsquo; - something human. If Irish
discusses China, the discussion will be Irish. If Hiberno-English
doesn&rsquo;t discuss Irish affairs, it&rsquo;s nothing but an English thing.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While Seán was writing from the zealous perspective of a fresh convert
(something I am also guilty of), I still think this difference he noted
is worth discussing. Rather than depicting shallow stereotypes for an
outside audience, there is a need for us to create art and literature
that inspires internal conversation. As opposed to endlessly fighting
online once our outer voice inevitably gets misinterpreted, there is a
need for us to restore an inner one. Returning to wa Thiong&rsquo;o, there is
a need for us to unshackle ourselves from our colonial relationship and
firmly root ourselves in the wider world - understanding who we are,
where we come from, and how much we can gain from reconquest. In the
crudest of words, we must stop believing that decolonisation will arrive
in the form of a belated thumbs up or an extended apology video. We must
also be aware that decolonisation won&rsquo;t solely arrive through the
cultural either - especially in two partitioned statelets. If anything,
decolonisation will mirror the words of Bobby Sands - with our children
laughing and thinking about anything other than their neighbours.
